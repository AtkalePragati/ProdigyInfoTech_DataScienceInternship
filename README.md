# TrafficAccidentAnalysis
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, lighting, and other key factors affecting accident trends. By leveraging Power BI and Data Science techniques, we extract meaningful insights that can help improve road safety and inform data-driven decision-making.

Key Insights

Crash Trends Over the Years – Analyzing accident frequency to identify patterns and trends.

Severity of Accidents with Lighting Conditions – Understanding how daylight, darkness, and poor lighting impact crash severity.

Weather-Related Crash Severity – Examining how rain, fog, snow, and other conditions influence accident rates.

Primary Contributory Causes vs. Roadway Surface Conditions – Assessing how wet, icy, or dry roads contribute to accidents.

Damage vs. Injuries – Comparing injury severity with property damage assessments.

Crash Types & Injury Reports – Identifying accident types that lead to the highest number of injuries.

Total Injuries Reported (Evident & Not Evident) – Analyzing reported vs. non-reported injuries in different crash scenarios.
